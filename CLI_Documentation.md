### The CLI works fairly simply. 

To dump a sequence:

* nodefile - Absolute Path to the nodefile you wish to load
* edgefile - Aboslute path to the edgefile you wish to load
* chromosome - Number of the chromosome you are currently evaluating
* sequenceName - The name of the strain you wish to retrieve the path for
`python CCGG_CLI.py nodefile edgefile chromosome [--sequence] sequenceName`
